# Prisoner Chessboard Riddle

One of my colleagues showed us this great riddle that I enjoyed so much that I wrote a python script to solve it.

### Outline of the riddle
There is a room with a chessboard. Each square on the chess board has a coin. Each coin is either heads or tails; the distribution of heads and tails is random.

Prisoner A enters the room. The warden points at a square on the chessboard. Then Prisoner A must flip a single coin. Prisoner A leaves the room.

Prisoner B enters the room and observes the chessboard. Prisoner B must then identify the square that the warden pointed out to Prisoner A.

In other words, Prisoner A must communicate the location of a square on the chessboard to Prisoner B using only a single coin flip. The square that the warden points to and the coin Prisoner A flips are not necessarily the same!
The prisoners are allowed to confer before the game begins to coordinate.
